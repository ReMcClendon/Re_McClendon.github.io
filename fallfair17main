                        At City Year, we believe education has the power to help every child reach his or her potential.  However, in high-poverty communities there are external factors and obstacles students are faced with every day that can interfere with their ability to both get to school and be ready and able to learn.

                        City Year works to bridge the gap in high-poverty communities between the support that students actually need and what their schools are designed and resourced to provide.  In doing so, we’re helping to increase graduation rates across the country and changing lives of the students we serve.

                        At City Year’s 28 locations across the United States and two international affiliates, highly trained young adults, our AmeriCorps Members, work full-time in schools for 11 months providing individualized supports to at-risk students.  We partner with schools and districts to identify students who are at risk of not graduating on time with their peers, and provide them with extra academic, emotional and social support an skills that they need to be successful for college and a career.

                        Known for attracting exceptional people who are passionate about service and the culinary arts, our performance-driven environment prepares you to build a rewarding career in hospitality. Your first exposure is an immersive 4 + months of rotational assignments in one of our restaurants. Because our managers come from all backgrounds and industries, you are not expected to be an expert on day one, but will be given many opportunities within a short time to show your strengths. From professional development workshops, to informal mentoring and guidance from your colleagues, we are creating well-rounded restaurateurs who are also savvy businesspeople. Outstanding graduates of our training program can earn the General Manager title in just a few years, and many General Managers in our company earn over $250K per year. Training occurs in Los Angeles, Napa, San Francisco, Washington D.C., Dallas, Phoenix, and New York City, with subsequent assignments in markets across the country, making relocation flexibility a must for consideration.
                         
                        Our management team search is focused on strong leaders who are dedicated to consistently driving high standards and achieving service excellence. Those who enjoy a small-company-feel, are adept at building relationships, and have a single-minded focus on delivering quality should apply.
                         
                        Recruiting for:

Interns are given opportunities to master many service and culinary roles (have you rolled sushi before?) and understand the manager's impact on the business.  The best apply their studies to our business and projects as they develop their culinary and management skills.
                         
                        Management Interns are often involved in hiring, staff supervision, vendor relations, financial analysis, etc. and work 50 hours per week. Compensation $900 per week.

MTS focuses on the following subsectors of the healthcare industry: healthcare services, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, generics, medical devices and diagnostics. Founded in 2000, MTS is distinguished by its dedicated healthcare industry focus, senior level hands-on deal execution, and the unique perspective and network MTS brings given the deep experience of its senior professional team - all without the conflicts of interest that most banks face. The U.S. and global healthcare industry is currently in the midst of unprecedented growth and change in a volatile economic environment; MTS plays a crucial role in advising our clients as they face critical strategic and financial decisions during these times. Uniquely, MTS’ business model focuses on alignment with our clients, building long-term relationships and engineering and executing the “right” transaction for our client. We specialize in executing complex transactions (e.g. mergers, restructurings, privately negotiated equity, structured debt, hybrid financings) where our “skill” as bankers is more important than the “scale” of an organization, such as in widely syndicated transactions (e.g. follow-on equity offerings, senior debt offerings). However, when a situation calls for a hybrid approach of private negotiation and public syndication, we also have the ability, as a registered broker-deal, and the flexibility to call on our experience and relationships to orchestrate the appropriate deal.  Whereas many banks are divided into industry coverage groups and product groups, the same deal team at MTS originates and executes the transaction, thus maintaining control of every aspect of advice, strategy, and execution and avoiding the conflicts of interest seen at other advisory firms. MTS Health Partners, L.P. is a fast-paced, collegial environment of approximately 35 banking professionals and 50 members overall with a tight-knit culture focused on professional growth.  Anchored by the foundation of a well-run partnership, junior team members have unparalleled access to Senior Bankers and are rewarded with responsibilities commensurate with demonstrated skill and professional maturity.  MTS promotes an environment based on teamwork, with an emphasis on entrepreneurship, accountability and innovation. MTS is dedicated to promoting from within the firm and developing each team member’s career. While we hope that each Associate will grow with MTS and eventually become a Senior Banker, the experience as an Investment Banking Associate at MTS will be excellent preparation for a career in industry, not-for profits, consulting, or other areas in finance.</div>

                        AmeriCorps is a network of local, state, and national service programs that connects more than 80,000 Americans each year in intensive service to meet our country’s critical needs in education, public safety, health, community, and the environment. Through AmeriCorps, the Schuler Scholar Program seeks recent college graduates to serve as AmeriCorps Scholar Coaches.

                        Scholar Coaches (SCs) serve a two year commitment and are based at a partnership high school. Service is mainly performed at the assigned school and occasionally at other sites or during college visits. SCs monitor the academic and personal/social development of the Scholars and serve as role models. Coaches work directly with Scholars in one-on-one and in group settings. Each SC will manage and deliver reading programming daily to a caseload of 10-15 Scholars. SCs tailor their tutoring and teaching style to meet the needs of each student. After school, SCs deliver Scholar Training and Enrichment Programs (STEPs) that focus on topics such as: the transition to high school, writing, math, decision making, and the transition to college. Additional SC responsibilities may include but are not limited to: subject specific tutoring with junior and senior Scholars, lead college-style seminars with junior and senior Scholars, design and implement new programming, plan and chaperone exposures (trips to the theatre, ballet, opera, museums), chaperone college visits, assist Scholars with the college and summer college program application process, participate in the Scholar selection process, plan and facilitate summer school programs, and manage the student information database.
                        SCs receive program specific training throughout the school year. Schuler ensures that SCs feel prepared, confident and supported while working with students and facilitating programs. The Schuler program staff provides ongoing support to SCs as needed. SCs can also take advantage of various professional development opportunities.

                        The Schuler Scholar Program is a private, non-profit foundation established in 2001 and based in the northern suburbs of Chicago.  Schuler serves students in 12 high schools located throughout the northern suburbs and the city of Chicago. Schuler currently serves over 900 high school and college Scholars.

                        Mission: The Schuler Scholar Program equips bright, motivated youth with the support they need to gain access to and succeed at highly selective colleges and beyond. Schuler Scholars come from populations that are under-represented on college campuses: Scholars are first-generation college-bound, are students of color or come from low-income families and communities.

                        Goals:   1. To foster the growth of Schuler Scholars as lifelong learners.
                        2. To provide information, guidance, and college preparatory experiences to help Schuler Scholars matriculate to the best fit college while maximizing financial aid options.
                        3. To support Schuler Scholars as they persist in their academic studies, personal growth, and professional development.

                        4. To cultivate an engaged network of Schuler alumni, mentors, and volunteers for lifelong connection and support.

                        The Schuler curriculum focuses on factors recognized as critical to academic success, leadership and personal development. Fostering growth in these areas promotes success in high school, college, and beyond. </div>

Some VTel farms and rural homes have received continuous telephone service from when we first began operations in 1890. We provided the phone line that enabled Calvin Coolidge to be sworn in as United States President, at Plymouth Notch, VT, on August 3, 1923. Several team members have been with us for 40 years. We answer our telephone calls on the first ring. We are Vermonters serving Vermonters. Our mission is World-Class Technology with Down-Home Service.
                        Some folks -- who aren’t yet our customers -- are surprised to learn VTel is proudly part of a U.S. tradition of small rural telephone companies who are also innovators. We were first in Vermont to offer Internet. We were first in Vermont to build gigabit-per-second fiber to homes. We were first with 100 Gig data paths. We expect to soon be first to integrate 4G LTE wireless mobile broadband with Smart Grid, to help make Vermont more green.
                        Since 1994 we have invested over $100 million of our own capital to upgrade our Vermont network, create local jobs, and build Vermont’s economy. We try to offer the lowest costs in Vermont, with the highest service quality. We take pride in public data showing we typically have the fewest complaints per 1,000 people served, of any carrier in the state.
                        We also operate a 1,400 mile optical fiber network from Vermont to New York City, Cambridge, MA, Boston, and Montreal, serving some of the most intensive data users and research universities in the northeast.
